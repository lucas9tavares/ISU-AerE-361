\section{Complexity Analysis}

For the \texttt{csvparse} code, the complexity will be of \textit{O(n*m)}, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the .csv file. We can conclude that coonsidering the nested loops iterating to create and print each element of the matrix.

\section{Loop Analysis}

The major loops contributing to complexity are the \texttt{while} loop that iterates over each row of the .csv file and the \texttt{for} loop (nested within tthe first one) that iterates over each column for each row, while constructing the matrix. The first loop runs \texttt{l} (number of rows) times, and the second loop runs \texttt{row1NumFields} times.

The \texttt{while} loop iterates over each row of the .csv file until there are no more rows to process, and the \texttt{for} loop iterates over each column of the current row until all columns are processed.

The loop used for dynamically allocating memory for the matrix does not contribute significantly to the complexity of the code.
